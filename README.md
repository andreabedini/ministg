Thank you for trying Ministg. Check out the [Documentation].

Install with `cabal install` from the root directory. Or `cabal install
ministg` from anywhere to install from hackage.

## Feedback, feature requests or bug reports

Bernie Pope: <http://www.berniepope.id.au>, alternatively issues on github.

## Usage

```
cd test
ministg sum.stg
```

Note that unless the flag `--noprelude` is passed, it'll expect it.
That's why you have to explicitly `cd` into the `test` folder.
